# Data Analysis
- Use this [squirrel data](./squirrel_data.csv) 
- Create a CSV named `squirrel_count.csv` that
    - has a small table that contains the fur colors(three) and the count of how many squirrels of each color there are in the data
    - build a new data frame from the squirrel fur colors
    - use the data frame to create a CSV file
- The Final CSV file should look something like:
    ```
    ,Fur Color,Count
    0,Grey,2473
    1,Red,392
    2,Black,103
    ```
